	volume = {95},
	issn = {0027-8424},
	abstract = {The mothers of infant rats show individual differences in the frequency of licking/grooming and arched-back nursing ({LG}-{ABN}) of pups that contribute to the development of individual differences in behavioral responses to stress. As adults, the offspring of mothers that exhibited high levels of {LG}-{ABN} showed substantially reduced behavioral fearfulness in response to novelty compared with the offspring of low {LG}-{ABN} mothers. In addition, the adult offspring of the high {LG}-{ABN} mothers showed significantly (i) increased central benzodiazepine receptor density in the central, lateral, and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala as well as in the locus ceruleus, (ii) increased alpha2 adrenoreceptor density in the locus ceruleus, and (iii) decreased corticotropin-releasing hormone ({CRH}) receptor density in the locus ceruleus. The expression of fear and anxiety is regulated by a neural circuitry that includes the activation of ascending noradrenergic projections from the locus ceruleus to the forebrain structures. Considering the importance of the amygdala, notably the anxiogenic influence of {CRH} projections from the amygdala to the locus ceruleus, as well as the anxiolytic actions of benzodiazepines, for the expression of behavioral responses to stress, these findings suggest that maternal care during infancy serves to "program" behavioral responses to stress in the offspring by altering the development of the neural systems that mediate fearfulness.},

	title = {Independent functions of viral protein and nucleic acid in growth of bacteriophage},
	volume = {36},
	issn = {0022-1295},
	abstract = {1. Osmotic shock disrupts particles of phage T2 into material containing nearly all the phage sulfur in a form precipitable by antiphage serum, and capable of specific adsorption to bacteria. It releases into solution nearly all the phage {DNA} in a form not precipitable by antiserum and not adsorbable to bacteria. The sulfur-containing protein of the phage particle evidently makes up a membrane that protects the phage {DNA} from {DNase}, comprises the sole or principal antigenic material, and is responsible for attachment of the virus to bacteria. 2. Adsorption of T2 to heat-killed bacteria, and heating or alternate freezing and thawing of infected cells, sensitize the {DNA} of the adsorbed phage to {DNase}. These treatments have little or no sensitizing effect on unadsorbed phage. Neither heating nor freezing and thawing releases the phage {DNA} from infected cells, although other cell constituents can be extracted by these methods. These facts suggest that the phage {DNA} forms part of an organized intracellular structure throughout the period of phage growth. 3. Adsorption of phage T2 to bacterial debris causes part of the phage {DNA} to appear in solution, leaving the phage sulfur attached to the debris. Another part of the phage {DNA}, corresponding roughly to the remaining half of the {DNA} of the inactivated phage, remains attached to the debris but can be separated from it by {DNase}. Phage T4 behaves similarly, although the two phages can be shown to attach to different combining sites. The inactivation of phage by bacterial debris is evidently accompanied by the rupture of the viral membrane. 4. Suspensions of infected cells agitated in a Waring blendor release 75 per cent of the phage sulfur and only 15 per cent of the phage phosphorus to the solution as a result of the applied shearing force. The cells remain capable of yielding phage progeny. 5. The facts stated show that most of the phage sulfur remains at the cell surface and most of the phage {DNA} enters the cell on infection. Whether sulfur-free material other than {DNA} enters the cell has not been determined. The properties of the sulfur-containing residue identify it as essentially unchanged membranes of the phage particles. All types of evidence show that the passage of phage {DNA} into the cell occurs in non-nutrient medium under conditions in which other known steps in viral growth do not occur. 6. The phage progeny yielded by bacteria infected with phage labeled with radioactive sulfur contain less than 1 per cent of the parental radioactivity. The progeny of phage particles labeled with radioactive phosphorus contain 30 per cent or more of the parental phosphorus. 7. Phage inactivated by dilute formaldehyde is capable of adsorbing to bacteria, but does not release its {DNA} to the cell. This shows that the interaction between phage and bacterium resulting in release of the phage {DNA} from its protective membrane depends on labile components of the phage particle. By contrast, the components of the bacterium essential to this interaction are remarkably stable. The nature of the interaction is otherwise unknown. 8. The sulfur-containing protein of resting phage particles is confined to a protective coat that is responsible for the adsorption to bacteria, and functions as an instrument for the injection of the phage {DNA} into the cell. This protein probably has no function in the growth of intracellular phage. The {DNA} has some function. Further chemical inferences should not be drawn from the experiments presented.},

	volume = {58},
	issn = {0146-0749},
	abstract = {Natural genetic transformation is the active uptake of free {DNA} by bacterial cells and the heritable incorporation of its genetic information. Since the famous discovery of transformation in Streptococcus pneumoniae by Griffith in 1928 and the demonstration of {DNA} as the transforming principle by Avery and coworkers in 1944, cellular processes involved in transformation have been studied extensively by in vitro experimentation with a few transformable species. Only more recently has it been considered that transformation may be a powerful mechanism of horizontal gene transfer in natural bacterial populations. In this review the current understanding of the biology of transformation is summarized to provide the platform on which aspects of bacterial transformation in water, soil, and sediments and the habitat of pathogens are discussed. Direct and indirect evidence for gene transfer routes by transformation within species and between different species will be presented, along with data suggesting that plasmids as well as chromosomal {DNA} are subject to genetic exchange via transformation. Experiments exploring the prerequisites for transformation in the environment, including the production and persistence of free {DNA} and factors important for the uptake of {DNA} by cells, will be compiled, as well as possible natural barriers to transformation. The efficiency of gene transfer by transformation in bacterial habitats is possibly genetically adjusted to submaximal levels. The fact that natural transformation has been detected among bacteria from all trophic and taxonomic groups including archaebacteria suggests that transformability evolved early in phylogeny. Probable functions of {DNA} uptake other than gene acquisition will be discussed. The body of information presently available suggests that transformation has a great impact on bacterial population dynamics as well as on bacterial evolution and speciation.},

Each measure was significantly correlated with the frequency of maternal licking and grooming (all r's {\textgreater} -0.6). These findings suggest that maternal behavior serves to "program" hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal responses to stress in the offspring.},

	abstract = {Early-life experiences can shape adult behavior, with consequences for fitness and health, yet fundamental questions remain unanswered about how early-life social experiences are translated into variation in brain and behavior. The African cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni, a model system in social neuroscience, is well known for its highly plastic social phenotypes in adulthood. Here, we rear juveniles in either social groups or pairs to investigate the effects of early-life social environments on behavior and neuroendocrine gene expression. We find that both juvenile behavior and neuroendocrine function are sensitive to early-life effects. Behavior robustly co-varies across multiple contexts (open field, social cue investigation, and dominance behavior assays) to form a behavioral syndrome, with pair-reared juveniles towards the end of syndrome that is less active and socially interactive. Pair-reared juveniles also submit more readily as subordinates. In a separate cohort, we measured whole brain expression of stress and sex hormone genes. Expression of glucocorticoid receptor ({GR}) 1a was elevated in group-reared juveniles, supporting a highly-conserved role for the stress axis mediating early-life effects. The effect of rearing environment on androgen receptor ({AR})  and estrogen receptor ({ER})  expression was mediated by treatment duration (1 vs. 5 weeks). Finally, expression of corticotropin-releasing factor ({CRF}) and {GR}2 decreased significantly over time. Rearing environment also caused striking differences in gene co-expression, such that expression was tightly integrated in pair-reared juveniles, but not group-reared or isolates. Together, this research demonstrates the important developmental origins of behavioral phenotypes and identifies potential behavioral and neuroendocrine mechanisms.},

	abstract = {The secretion of glucocorticoids ({GCs}) is a classic endocrine response to stress. Despite that, it remains controversial as to what purpose {GCs} serve at such times. One view, stretching back to the time of Hans Selye, posits that {GCs} help mediate the ongoing or pending stress response, either via basal levels of {GCs} permitting other facets of the stress response to emerge efficaciously, and/or by stress levels of {GCs} actively stimulating the stress response. In contrast, a revisionist viewpoint posits that {GCs} suppress the stress response, preventing it from being pathologically overactivated. In this review, we consider recent findings regarding {GC} action and, based on them, generate criteria for determining whether a particular {GC} action permits, stimulates, or suppresses an ongoing stress-response or, as an additional category, is preparative for a subsequent stressor. We apply these {GC} actions to the realms of cardiovascular function, fluid volume and hemorrhage, immunity and inflammation, metabolism, neurobiology, and reproductive physiology. We find that {GC} actions fall into markedly different categories, depending on the physiological endpoint in question, with evidence for mediating effects in some cases, and suppressive or preparative in others. We then attempt to assimilate these heterogeneous {GC} actions into a physiological whole.},

	abstract = {In the rat, variations in maternal care appear to influence the development of behavioral and endocrine responses to stress in the offspring. The results of cross-fostering studies reported here provide evidence for (i) a causal relationship between maternal behavior and stress reactivity in the offspring and (ii) the transmission of such individual differences in maternal behavior from one generation of females to the next. Moreover, an environmental manipulation imposed during early development that alters maternal behavior can then affect the pattern of transmission in subsequent generations. Taken together, these findings indicate that variations in maternal care can serve as the basis for a nongenomic behavioral transmission of individual differences in stress reactivity across generations.},

	doi = {10.1006/gcen.1995.1006},
	abstract = {The ontogeny of the interrenal stress response in rainbow trout was characterized by measuring resting and acute-stress-induced changes in whole-body cortisol levels in embryos and larvae at different early developmental stages. In Experiment 1, resting cortisol levels averaged 6.0 ng/g in newly fertilized eggs, fell to less than 0.3 ng/g by the time of hatching at Week 4 (incubation at 10 degrees), and increased to 1.4 ng/g by Week 5. Cortisol levels did not change in response to acute stress in 3-, 4-, or 5-week-old fish. In Experiment 2, resting cortisol averaged 1.4 ng/g in newly fertilized eggs, fell to less than 0.03 ng/g by Week 2, and then steadily increased between Weeks 3 and 6 to a peak of 4.8 ng/g before falling to 1.2 ng/g by Week 7. Cortisol levels did not change in response to acute stress in 3-, 4-, or 5-week-old fish. Six-week-old fish showed a 2.3-fold increase in cortisol levels at 1 hr poststress, indicating that the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal axis first develops responsiveness to stress 2 weeks after hatching and 1 week before the onset of exogenous feeding. The stress hyporesponsive period after hatching in rainbow trout may be homologous to the 2-week stress hyporesponsive period after birth in rodents, the function of which may be to maintain low, constant corticosteroid levels during a critical developmental period when these steroids can have permanent effects on neural organization. As suggested for mammals, this period may be a time when rainbow trout are particularly vulnerable to environmental effects on their subsequent development.},

	shorttitle = {Long-term effects of prenatal stress and postnatal handling on age-related glucocorticoid secretion and cognitive performance},
	abstract = {There is growing evidence that stress during prenatal and postnatal periods of life can modify adaptive capacities in adulthood. The hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis may mediate an animal's responses to perinatal stressful events and thus serve as a neurobiological substrate of the behavioural consequences of these early events. However, little is known about the long-term effects of prenatal stressors throughout the entire life of the animals. The focus of the present study was to examine the long-term influences of a prenatal and postnatal stress on glucocorticoid secretion and cognitive performance. Prenatal stress of rat dams during the last week of pregnancy and postnatal daily handling of rat pups during the first 3 weeks of life were used as stressors. The long-term effects of these manipulations were analysed using a longitudinal approach throughout the entire life of the animals, and were repeatedly tested in adulthood (4-7 months), middle age (13-16 months) and in later life (20-24 months). The study demonstrated that prenatal stress and postnatal handling induced opposite effects on both glucocorticoid secretion and cognitive performance. Prenatal stress accelerated the age-related hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunctions; indeed, circulating glucocorticoids levels of prenatally stressed middle-aged animals are similar to old control ones, and also induced cognitive impairments. In contrast, postnatal handling protected from the age-related neuroendocrine and behavioural alterations. These results show that the altered glucocorticoid secretion induced by early environmental manipulations is primary to the cognitive alterations observed only later in life and could be one cause of age-related memory deficits.},
